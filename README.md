<p>I needed a simple visual animation on idle screens during the dead times of a demo.</p>

<p>These html files originate from examples taken from (https://exploratoria.github.io/exhibits/mechanics/) </p>

<p>They have been substantially modified to fix the bugs, correct the dynamics and side effects, handle
collisions and then implement the leapfrog technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration)
for a better stability and improved rendering</p>
